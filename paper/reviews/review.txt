	First referee's report

The article proposes a new estimator for the density matrix in quantum
homodyne tomography in a framework of noisy data.
The article has well-written introduction, which substantiates an
importance of the article and explains its relation to the previous work.
The convergence rate of the proposed estimator is proved mathematically
and illustrated with numerical simulation.
All the statements of the article are scientifically correct.
I suggest to publish the article. I only found one misprint on the page 8,
line 10: “W e define” should be “We define”

	Second referee's report

The Authors analyze quantum homodyne tomography and propose a method
for quantum state reconstruction under the hypothesis that the state
to be reconstructed satisfies certain constraints on the absolute
values of the number-state basis. The Authors provide analytic bounds
on the convergence rate of the reconstruction and simulations of the
reconstruction.

The paper is nice and well written, although it is not immediately
clear if it would be useful in practical situations, as a method for
practical reconstructions. Moreover a few issues should be
addressed. In particular:

1) The Authors state that there is no closed-form expression for the
pattern functions. This is incorrect, for example it seems to me that
a closed form is given in Eq. (30) of [G. M. D'Ariano, Measuring
Quantum States, in Quantum Optics and Spectroscopy of Solids, ed. by
T. Hakioglu and A. S. Shumovsky, (Kluwer Academic Publisher, Amsterdam
1997), page 175]. That is a review paper, so this result has certainly
appeared elsewhere, possibly in Phys. Rev. A 52, 4899 (1995) or some
other paper connected to that. I suggest that the Authors use the
closed form expression for the pattern functions in their
reconstructions.

2) It is not clear how this method compares with the totally unbiased
methods that are already available, such as the ones detailed in the
above papers (which are also detailed in some of the papers presented
in the bibliography). Since those other methods do not require any
condition on the state to be reconstructed, the method presented here
would be of interest only if the reconstruction converges more quickly
than those. It is not at all clear it does: the bounds derived and the
simulations presented seem to point to a rather slow convergence.

3) It is curious that the simulations are performed with a very small
number of data (between 10^4 and 10^6) whereas experimentally number
of data much larger (typically 10^8 and easily more) are available. Is
there some limitation of the method that prevents the simulations from
running with a more realistic number of data?

4) A minor point, in Fig. 4, it is not immediately clear what the
dashed lines mean, as they are not referenced in the figure caption
(in addition to the fact that it would be better not to use
color-codes, as it becomes very confusing when the paper is printed in
black-and-white). I suggest the figure to be amended.

In conclusion, I suggest the Authors amend the paper to overcome the
issues pointed out above before their paper can be published.

	Board Member's report

The authors solve a very ill-posed inverse problem in quantum optics.
Their goal is to reconstruct the density matrix of monochromatic light in
a cavity modeled by a quantum oscillator. Much of the start of the article
is devoted to describing the physical problem and related mathematics.
Then, they describe the experiment and their mathematical results.

The abstract and introduction are appropriately clear. The article seems
well-written and it seems on the more experimental end of articles in
Inverse Problems.
